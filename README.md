# Raspberry-Pi-Spectrometer (Spectrometer Mk1)

A DIY, low-cost spectrometer built around Raspberry Pi, a camera module, a slit, and a transmission diffraction grating.
This project captures a slit image + its 1st order spectrum, then extracts an intensity-vs-pixel spectrum for comparison and future wavelength calibration.
